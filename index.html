          <span class="color-header">APARTMENT PLACE</span>
          in Bountiful, UT</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Apartment Place, where being an apartment complex is what we’re doing. These buildings are fairly stationary,
          having concrete foundations and being too large for standard-size pockets. There is a tennis court and a pool,
          too, and your living box has an oven and some light fixtures. These living boxes feature some appliances, countertops,
          and some carpeting while also leaving enough space for you to sit with your things and maybe eat and have a conversation.
          We also have a gym (kinda) and some mailboxes and some covered parking. We have open parking, too, but there’s
          a bar across the street, and patrons frequently park illegally in resident parking. There’s a pool (some say it
          sparkles), a hot tub, a manager, and a maintenance man. We’re friendly to each other. Maybe we'll be friendly to
          you, too, if you’re cool, nomsayn?</p>
        <br>

        <p>I-15 North access is as convenient as it gets with the onramp just a couple hundred feet away. We're pretty close
          to downtown SLC, too (about 15 minutes), but far enough away to escape the busy-ness of the city. We take pictures
          sometimes while our tenants are out – you’ll find those below (we'll take them down for a small fee - $200 each.).
          You should come visit us because we’d like to profit from your poor life choices that have thus far prevented you
          from buying your own house.</p>

        <h3>EXPERIENCE
          <span class="color-header">1980s ARCHITECTURE – AGAIN</span>
          <br> STILL CLEAN AND SERVICEABLE, BUT PROBABLY ON ITS LAST LEG</h3>
        <p>Apartment Place Apartments are available. Choose from units featuring layouts, square footage*, rooms, and semi-permanent
          features like toilets and a furnace. These apartments are pretty large as apartments go, but you’ll still eventually
          feel cramped. Just imagine you’re in the navy and you’ve shipped out on a submarine where space for your stuff
          is precious and rare and fills up far more quickly than you ever would have imagined. As with any apartment the
          world 'round, minimalism is your friend.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="footnote">*Square Footage is a measurement of the area of the apartment, obviously, so don’t believe a word of this unless
          you like math. Price and Availability are subject to change. Don’t blame us if we’re too awesome for you.</p>

        <h4>“How come they call them apartments when they’re all stuck together? They ought to be called togetherments.” – Gallagher</h4>
        <h3>FEATURING
          <span class="color-header">AMENITIES</span> (YAY!)
          <br> at APARTMENT PLACE APARTMENTS</h3>
        <p>Accessibility is one of those keywords that sounds like something you’d want when it comes to looking for a place
          to live. That's why we say things are accessible from here. We’re in the heart of Bountiful, but hopefully we won’t
          give it a heart attack. We don’t actually know if this area has a low crime rate (and the presence of Bountiful’s
          only bar a stone’s throw away makes that seem unlikely), but we can say that this area has a low
          <span class="bent-letters">arrest</span> rate.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Pets are welcome here, and we do provide gloves and receptacles to help you clean up after your dog, so quit being
          a jerk and clean up after your dog. I don’t mind you having a dog – I like dogs. But it isn’t
          <span class="bent-letters">my</span> dog, so please don’t make the grass into a minefield.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are community grills available, but I’ve never seen anyone use them. But that’s cool because grills are allowed
          on your back deck, too. Just try to be cool with your neighbors. And while we’re on the subject, remember that
          you share walls with your neighbors. Walking on your heels sounds like a herd of elephants training for the Olympic
          tap-dancing team to your neighbors below. And we know how amazing that movie sounds with your new 7.2 surround
          sound system, but all we can hear down here is your subwoofer, so it’s hard to follow along with whatever explosion-filled
          action movie you’re falling asleep to this time. Please stop.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Anyway, we hope you’ll move in, pay your rent on time, pick up your stupid packages, and don’t complain too much.
          And leave us a nice review on the Google.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thanks,</p>
        <br>

        </h3>
        <p>Throughout Apartment Place’s landscaped grounds of green grass and bluegrass bands, chain link fences and construction
          zone views, you’ll find a range of people to avoid because nobody really gets to know their neighbors in an apartment
          complex. This isn’t
          <span class="bent-letters">'Friends'</span>. There’s a pool, but you probably won’t want to use it unless there’s nobody in it because Americans
          don’t like mingling with the riff-raff. Get off my lawn.</p>
        <br>

        <p>The apartments at Apartment Place are just adequate enough to maintain 80% occupancy. Here, you'll have all the things
          we in the developed world have learned to take for granted, spoiled little shits that we are. Clean and plentiful
          water on demand, systemic and effective sanitation so we don’t have to empty our chamber pots into the street,
          a cooking fire at the touch of a button or twist of a knob, constant climate control, political stability, and
          freedom from all but economic oppression.

          <br>AT APARTMENT PLACE - THE PERFECT LOCATION TO TAKE UP SPACE AND WAIT TO DIE</h3>
        <p>You’ll find Apartment Place apartments to be both convenient and accessible to all the things that are relatively
          close by. There are places to buy things, and there are probably places to sell things, but, you know, now that
          I’m thinking of it, I have to say I’ve never seen a pawn shop in Bountiful. There’s a library and a police station.
          And a Del Taco. That’s pretty cheap. And if you go too far west, you’ll just come back because it stinks out there.</p>
        <br>

        <p>We also have schools, grocery stores, mountains, and I-15. Concerts don’t come here (except maybe local bands occasionally
          at the bar across the street), but downtown SLC isn’t far, so there’s that. Bountiful is quiet and out of the way,
          but it’s not out of range of the good stuff. We like it here, so don’t screw it up, ok? </p>
